## 🌟 Overview
The **DIY Home Project Planner** is a Flutter mobile app that helps users plan, organize, and track home improvement or DIY projects.  
It allows users to create detailed project boards with steps, materials, photos, and cost tracking — all stored locally for offline access.

This Milestone 2 version builds upon Milestone 1 by introducing **persistent local storage**, **photo attachments**, a **timeline view**, and **PDF export**.
